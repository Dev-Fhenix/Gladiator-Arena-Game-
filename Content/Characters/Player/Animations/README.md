# Player Animation Assets

This directory is intended to hold player animation assets and blend spaces.
Import the Unreal Engine default mannequin animations here, including:

- Walk/Run Blend Space (`ThirdPersonWalkRun_BlendSpace`)
- Hand-to-hand combat montages
- Kick, Block, and Sword attack animations

These assets should be created inside Unreal Editor and saved into this folder.
